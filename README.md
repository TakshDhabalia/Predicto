# **Customer Purchase Prediction Using ML**  

### **Project Overview**  
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the probability of a customer purchasing a product based on keyword searches.The dataset includes customer transactions, product details, and customer demographic information. A cosine similarity approach is used to find related product IDs from a keyword, and various ML models are explored to improve prediction accuracy.
  


### **About the dataset**  
The dataset contains following files:  
**1. customer_info** : Provides information of customers who have purchased 
atleast one product   
**2. product_info**:  Provides list of products your company sells  
**3. customer_transaction_info**: Provides information of orders, product & relevant 
information that customers bought  
**4. orders_returned_info**: 
Orders that the customers have returned either they didn't 
like the product or damaged or other reason unknown  
**5. region_seller_info**:  Customers region covered by your sales team  



### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing   
- Visualizations  
- Customer behaviour analysis  
- Customer regional analysis  
- Purchase Patterns & Trends  

### **Installation**
### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)  
- Python Virtual Environment (recommended)

### **Install Dependencies**  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- For UI  
```
cd UI  
npm install

```

### **Results**  
- Model Performance Metrics
- Visualization of customer purchase behavior
- Probability-based product recommendations


### **Future Scope**
- Incorporate more behavioral data
- Use of reinforcement learning to account for new data
- Optimize model using deep learning techniques
